# Taelang

Taelin's personal productivity language!

Unlike [Kind](https://github.com/higherorderco/kind), Taelang has no obligation
to be easy, friendly or appealing to anyone else but me. Here, I do anything I
want, the way I want, with as many parenthesis as I want. Now, go away!

```
> Here comes a thought
> That might alarm you
> What someone said
> And how it harmed you
> Something you did
> That failed to be charming
> Things that you said are
> Suddenly swarming, and oh!

> You're losing sight
> You're losing touch
> All these little things
> Seem to matter so much
> That they confuse you
> That I might lose you

> Take a moment, remind yourself to
> Take a moment and find yourself
> Take a moment to ask yourself
> If this is how we fall apart

> But it's not, but it's not, but it's not, but it's not, but it's not
> It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
> You've got nothing, got nothing
> Got nothing, got nothing to fear
> I'm here, I'm here, I'm here
```
